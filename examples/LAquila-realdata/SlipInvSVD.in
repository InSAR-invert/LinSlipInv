Data (1 = synthetic data, 0 = read from files, -1 = custom target model from a file)
0
Std.dev for slip rate (0 = no smoothing), Std.dev for GF's, GPS weight, M0 constraint weight, Weight of additional constraint
1.d0  0.1  .1d0   1.d0   0.d0
Station component weights (1=no distance distance-dependent weights, 2=distance-dependent approximated CD)
1
Choice of use of eigenvectors (see further)
1
1: single minimum singular value, 2: defined min and max number of eigenvectors to be considered
10.
Additional temporal shift (in sec)
1.
