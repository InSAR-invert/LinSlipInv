Data (1 = synthetic data, 0 = read from files)
0
Std.dev for slip velocity (0. = no smoothing), Std.dev for GF's, Weight of GPS, Weight of M0 constraint, Weight of additional constraint
1.d0  0.1  .1d0   1.d0   0.d0
Station component weights (0 = weights based on distance, 1 = no distance dependence of weights)
1
Choice of use of eigenvectors (see further)
1
1: defined minimum singular value, 2: defined min and max number of eigenvectors to be taken into account
10.
Additional temporal shift (in sec)
1.
